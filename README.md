# COMPARE-TWO-LINKED-LIST
This code defines a basic singly linked list with node and list classes for storing integers and appending them efficiently, plus a `PrintSinglyLinkedList` method to output the list with separators. The core `CompareLists` function traverses two lists side-by-side, comparing each node's data and ensuring both end simultaneously, returning true only if they're identical.
